      <h1>Our Solar System</h1>
      <p>The solar system is the group of objects that orbit the Sun, our star. It includes eight planets, many moons, asteroids, comets and other small bodies. There are eight planets in our solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune1. They are divided into two groups: terrestrial planets and gas giants. Terrestrial planets are rocky and have solid surfaces. Gas giants are mostly made of gas and have no definite surface.</p>

      <h3>The Sun</h3>
      <p>The Sun is the center of the solar system and the source of light and heat for all the other objects. It is a yellow star that is about 4.6 billion years old. It makes up 99.86% of the mass of the solar system.</p>
      <h3>Earth</h3>
      <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only one known to have life. It has a moderate climate, a rich variety of living organisms, and a natural satellite called the Moon. It rotates on its axis once every 24 hours and orbits the Sun once every 365 days. Earth has a solid and active surface with mountains, valleys, canyons, plains and so much more. Earth is special because it is an ocean planet. Water covers 70% of Earthâ€™s surface1. The surface is divided into seven large landmasses called continents and many smaller islands.</p>
